# Critter_Squash
This is a "Critter Squash" game developed for a CS class assignment.

This program dynamically creates a grid based off of user input and then inserts a "C" character, denoting a critter, to a random position in that grid. Once this happens, the critter moves around the grid until it is no longer within the bounds of the grid after moving. The critter has four move options: up, down, left, right, and up. 

The program returns "critter is squashed!" and the number of moves it took for the critter to move out of bounds of the grid 

Enjoy!
